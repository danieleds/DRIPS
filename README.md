### Decentralized Relative Inertial Positioning System
_Daniele Di Sarli, Diego Giorgini_

This proof of concept implements a detection, communication and coordination system between small-scaled cars in a crossroad without any centralised infrastructure.

Each car is able to:
 * detect other vehicles around it
 * communicate with them in order to compute the precedence according to road rules, or to signal an emergency situation
